# Sliding-Puzzle-with-Different-Algorithms
This program is very slow for puzzles that need many moves to complete.  Currently it runs a single puzzle with breadth-first-search, Greedy breath-first-search with Manhattan Distance, and A*.  For optimal results with better speed use A*.  Greedy can be faster, but itâ€™s variant and can produce results that are not optimal.
